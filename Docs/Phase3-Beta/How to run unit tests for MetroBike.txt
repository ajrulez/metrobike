Unit testing instructions

After completing the 'How to checkout MetroBike from scratch' instructions:

1) Launch Eclipse

2) Either launch an emulator instance -or- attach an Android 4.0.3+ device

3) Right-click on the MetroBikeTest project (the source for this project is in <repo-root>/MetroBike/test/src)

4) Run-as->Android JUnit test

Note: Your emulator or Android device must have Internet access to run the tests, as several test our ability to connect to Google
